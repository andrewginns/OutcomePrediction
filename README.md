# OutcomePrediction
Jupyter Notebook to predict whether or not students successfully complete training courses. Code should serve as a relatively general base for binary or multi-class predictions.

Originally produced over 2 working days for a Hackathon. 

## The Data
The data is from Primary Education and provides information on ~12,000 students. This includes demographic, geographical region, essay scores, module completion etc.

Un-obscured data source is unfortunately not available to be posted publicly. Picked data files provide usable dataframes for running the notebooks.

## The Aim
Predict whether or not a given student will finish a training course (0 = Not Complete, 1 = Complete)
